## Why in english?

Yes, english is not my mother tongue. I want to write my posts in english to improve my english skills.  
Another reason is the so much bigger audience. Especially in the tech
community. [more info](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_language).

## Why should this work now?

I always wanted to write my own blog website with its own backend. But these had never a good user experience and were
lacking many features. All these features are in Wordpress but as a Laravel developer I don't like the Wordpress eco
system and how to build stuff with it. Another reason was that I needed this whole page as my own side project. And I
don't want to work only with Wordpress in my spare time.

### Laravel Nova

I wrote a very simple blog with a [Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) backend. The posts are written in Markdown.  
To have a good writing experience, I write the my posts in [Bear](https://bear.app/) and copy them into the Nova backend
afterwards.

## Let's start!

Hopefully this time I will continue to write blog posts. Fingers crossed!
