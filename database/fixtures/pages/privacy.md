# Privacy

{.font-serif .text-lg .leading-normal .mb-8}
I am an ambassador of privacy rights. Thus I highly welcome that the European Union introduces
extensive privacy regulations. Herewith I assure that as long as you are not getting in touch with
me by email, you are surfing anonymously on my website.

## Cookies

{.font-serif .leading-loose .text-grey-darker .mb-4}
This website uses non personal related cookies solely for technical and security reason. Cookies are
tiny text files stored on your device. However, cookies are not evil by default. The cookies I use
do not process any personal data.

## Logfiles

{.font-serif .leading-loose .text-grey-darker .mb-4}
My server collects log files from each user session for auditing and security purposes. Those
information are provided by your web browser and usually include technical data such as type and
version of your browser, operating system, referer URL, time of request as well as personal data
such as your IP address.

{.font-serif .leading-loose .text-grey-darker .mb-4}
Before logging I anonymize your IP address by replacing the last three digits with an 'X'. This
process makes the log files solely of technical nature without any possibility (at least to my
knowledge) to trace the data back to a person.

## Getting in touch

{.font-serif .leading-loose .text-grey-darker .mb-4}
I welcome you to get in touch with me to discuss possible cooperation. This way I do collect
personal data from you like your email address and any other personal data that you may reveal
within the process of our communication.

{.font-serif .leading-loose .text-grey-darker .mb-4}
I view those communication requests as steps prior entering into a contract (Art. 6, GDPR, paragraph
1,b). If you get in touch with me, I assume you accept this view. I will delete your personal data
as soon as our contract ends or I as soon as I realize that we are not going to enter into a
contract.

## Rights of the data subject

{.font-serif .leading-loose .text-grey-darker .mb-4}
I welcome that the GDPR provides the data subject, meaning you, the right to access your processed
data at any time. Further you have the right to restrict the processing of your data among other. If
you want to demand any of your rights, please get in touch with me and I do my best to match your
expectations. Visit the <a href="/legal-notice">legal notice</a> page for my contact data.
